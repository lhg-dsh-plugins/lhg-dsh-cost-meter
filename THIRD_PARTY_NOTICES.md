# DSH native presentation components

The display settings preview reuses selected SVG artwork and presentation CSS from @deepseek-ai/dsh-client-ui-primitives, @deepseek-ai/dsh-client-ui-sidebar and @deepseek-ai/dsh-client-ui-conversation, version 0.2.0-rc.2. Source: the corresponding packages shipped with DeepSeek Harness Desktop.

Artwork is reused without geometry changes. Presentation styles are scoped and adapted into separate regions at normal text size. The preview uses the host's exported primitives when available.

# WorkBuddy credential and billing support

Adapted from [corrinehu/dsh-workbuddy-connect](https://github.com/corrinehu/dsh-workbuddy-connect), `src/auth.ts` and `src/upstream.ts`. Local credentials are read only; this plugin does not refresh tokens.

The additional usage-route compatibility is based on the public API of [dingminhua/dsh-connect-workbuddy](https://github.com/dingminhua/dsh-connect-workbuddy/tree/2c1626b8dc46e16561924b76ac6cd86b4272e45d) 4.13.1 (`src/status-paths.ts`, `src/web-status.ts`; MIT, Copyright (c) 2026 LaoDing). Tests execute its published route with synthetic dependencies; its credential and account-management implementation is not included in this package.
